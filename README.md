# Vitalis , An All IN One SPace Biology Knowledge Engine
Built for the Nasa Space Apps Challenge,
Vitalis is a knowledge platform designed to make NASA’s space biology research accessible, organized, and interactive. It consolidates over 600 research papers from NASA into a single platform, allowing users to explore, understand, and connect scientific insights efficiently. Users can register as students, researchers, or investors, and Vitalis tailors summaries and recommendations to their background. The platform goes beyond traditional search tools by offering contextual search, editable summaries, and a discussion system for collaboration. Each paper can be added to a personal “Knowledge Journal”, a visual mind map that shows connections between research topics, findings, and emerging ideas. By turning dense scientific data into an intuitive, interactive experience, Vitalis helps learners, scientists, and innovators navigate NASA’s space biology research and uncover new insights.

Vitalis is an intelligent research platform built to unify NASA’s scattered space biology archives. It collects over 600 space biology papers provided by NASA and organizes them into a single, interactive hub. Using the OpenAI API suite (GPT-4o mini), Vitalis automatically summarizes each paper, tailoring the level of detail and tone according to the user’s demographic: students and researchers receive technically rich yet digestible summaries, while investors get concise insights emphasizing relevance and potential applications.

Each paper page includes a discussion thread via Hyvor Talk, encouraging global collaboration and interdisciplinary dialogue. Users can also add papers to a personal, visual “Research Journal” powered by React Flow, allowing them to organize and connect studies through a mind-map interface.

Vitalis was built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, React Flow, OpenAI API, and HyvorTalk for engagement. Its creativity lies in merging summarization, personalization, and visualization, three distinct functions rarely unified in scientific research tools.

Our team designed Vitalis to make space biology more discoverable, reduce information overload, and help emerging scientists and investors navigate research with clarity. In a world where data grows faster than comprehension, Vitalis turns complexity into connection, bridging innovation and understanding in the final frontier.
